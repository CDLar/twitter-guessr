This project was created by Curtis Daniel Larsen

## Project Overview

This application links to a Twitter Developer account to Tweet data from the official Twitter API and create multi-choice quizzes from the data.

Twitter widgets are used to display the Tweets as well as the Tweet name handles used for the answers.

All previously answered questions as well as scores/results are stored locally to prevent repeat questions and track high-scores.

There are two quizzes currently available:

## Historic Quiz

Made from the most popular Tweets on Twitter since it's creation.

## Daily Quiz

An updating quiz made from popular recent Tweets.
